We code, but (mostly) cannot surf.

`#codesurfers` is an IRC channel on the OFTC network, that's been running since 2010. You'll need an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) client to connect.

We are not very chatty, but stick around for a bit, and someone may say something.

This is the companion website. Have a look around, and have fun.
