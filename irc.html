      <h2> The #codesurfers IRC channel </h2>

      <p> #codesurfers is an IRC channel in the OFTC network. </p>

      <p>
        We mostly talk about programming, free software and their
        related issues, so if you like talking about such things, we
        welcome you to #codesurfers. Even if you don't, feel free to
        join and say "Hi" as our interests aren't limited to only
        programming.
      </p>

      <h2> Join us! </h2>

      <p>
        First of all you'll need to use an irc client. Some commonly
        used IRC clients on Linux are
        are <a href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a>,
        <a href="http://www.weechat.org/">weechat</a>
        and <a href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a> can be used in
        conjunction with
        a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a>
        session to keep it running indefinitely on a VPS.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are usually the most chatty between 2300-0300. A response
        time less than an hour is considered okay on IRC.
