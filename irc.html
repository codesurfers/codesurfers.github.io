      <p> #codesurfers is an IRC channel in the OFTC network. </p>

      <p>
        We mostly talk about programming, free software and their
        related issues, so if you like talking about such things, we
        welcome you to #codesurfers. Even if you don't, feel free to
        join and say "Hi" as our interests aren't limited to only
        programming.
