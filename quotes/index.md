#### General

Enlightenment is probably antithetical to impatience.

People who want to learn are, however, always welcome.  People who
respect knowledge, know what it costs to acquire it.  People who do
not know its costs will generally not respect it, either.

Eric Naggum

#### Free Software

Free software is the world's most advanced technical education
system. It allows anybody, anywhere in the world, to get to the state
of the art in anything computers can be made to do, by reading what
is fully available, by experimenting with it and by sharing the
consequences freely.

Eben Moglen
