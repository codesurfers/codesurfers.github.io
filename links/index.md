[Steve Yegge's interview prep advice](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.in/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)

## Tools

### General Programmer Tools

You will have to be familiar with the development tools like
the compiler/interpreter and debugger because you'll be
spending a sizeable amount of your time working with them.

[gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)

The GNU Debugger can help with finding what's going wrong
with your program. It's usually used to debug C/C++
programs.

[ccache](https://ccache.samba.org/)

Building large projects can take a significant amount of
time. ccache can help with reducing the time spent
waiting for the build to finish.

### Text editors

Knowing how to efficiently use a text editor is one of the most useful
secondary skills of any programmer.

Among the free text editors, vim and emacs have (unfortunately) been
the state of the art for quite some time now.

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/others.php)

A modal text editor that has nice key bindings and an
emphasis on speed. It is an important command-line
survival skill. Once installed, run the "vimtutor" command
to start a basic tutorial.

[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/)

An operating system containing (amongst many, many other things) a
file manager, calculator, games, package manager and even a text
editor.

It can be extended in trivial, and extremely non-trivial ways with
Emacs Lisp, which also happens to be the language it is written in.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

A modern open-source text editor developed by Microsoft.

[Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/)

An easy to use, feature-laden text editor.

### Version Control

A Version Control System (VCS) is used to track changes in
files. Even the most trivial projects can quickly become
unmanageable if a VCS is not used.

[Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)

A solid introduction to the powerful Git version control system.

[Mercurial](http://hginit.com/01.html)

Mercurial is easier to learn and use when compared to
Git. This tutorial covers the fundamental idea behind version control
and basic usage of Mercurial.

[Commit message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

It is important to write good commit messages so that commit history
is readable.

### Command-line

Mastering the command line shell gives you unfathomable power and more
importantly nerd cred. ;-)

[zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zsh)

A shell with nice completions and other customisable features.

[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)

Switching between multiple terminal emulator instances can
hamper productivity. This terminal multiplexer can be used
with a tiling window manager for a killer combination.

[GNU coreutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities)

The GNU coreutils bundled with GNU/Linux can be used to
perform straighforward tasks, and also arcane
wizardry.

For as long as text terminals are used, it will be worth your while to
be comfortable with using these.

[hh](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr)

Allows you to easily view, navigate, search and manage your command
history.

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

A command line fuzzy finder.

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

Similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack
and grep which can be used to search directories recursively.

### Window Managers

#### Tiling

Tiling window managers are useful in a typical programming session
when you have to repeatedly switch between your text-editor, terminal
emulator, web-browser, and any number of other programs you may have
running. Alt-Tab never again!

[xmonad](http://xmonad.org/)

A tiling window manager written in Haskell.

### Graphics

[Inkscape](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/)

The best open source SVG editor there is. Also allows importing from,
exporting to the commonly used graphical formats.

### Miscellaneous

[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html)

Easily converts between a great variety of markup formats.

## CS Theory

### Algorithms

[Big-O Cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

A handy cheatsheet of algorithmic complexities associated with
commonly used data structures and algorithms.

## References

Learning to use references is one of the essential skills of a
programmer. References are by necessity large and intimidating, but
with time they become indispensable.

### Programming Language References

#### C++

[C++ Reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/)

Handy quick reference while writing C++ code. It can be
downloaded for offline use.

[C++ Reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)

Another reference on C++. It has clear examples to help
you learn how to use the standard library.

[C++ FAQ](http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq/)

Fairly large collection of C++ FAQs and their answers.

[C++ FQA](http://www.yosefk.com/c++fqa/index.html)

C++ Frequently Questioned Answers.

[Official C++ FAQ](http://isocpp.org/wiki/faq)

#### Common Lisp

[Simplified Common Lisp Reference](http://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/index.html)

A selection of commonly used symbols.

[Common Lisp HyperSpecâ„¢ ](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm)

The entire ANSI CL standard in HTML. Rather readable.

### Protocols, Specifications

[RFC](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index2.html)

Freely available specifications for various internet-related protocols.

## Programming Exercises

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

A good source of many exercise problems. Many of the
problems here require some mathematical (and programming)
knowledge.

[Programming Praxis](http://programmingpraxis.com/)

Some practical programming problems in addition to the sorts of
problems found at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

[Problem of the Day](http://www.problemotd.com/)

Fun exercises.

## Operating Systems

Any operating system that you are productive in, and happy
with, is fine. If that is not the case, however, these are
some of our recommendations.

[Debian](http://www.debian.org/)

[neena](http://neena.at/) says that it is a decent operating system. A
widely used, stable Linux distribution.

[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)

A Linux distribution with an emphasis on simplicity, configurability
and having the latest software packages. Rolling releases keep your
system at the bleeding edge.
