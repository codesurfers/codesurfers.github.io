## Programming

### Tutorials

If you are new to programming, it might be better to read
[SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) or the
[Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) first.

- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

An introduction to computation and programming.

- [Learn you a Haskell for great good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

A good tutorial to learn the basics of functional programming with Haskell.

- [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html)

A modern introduction to web development using Javascript.

- [Why's poignant guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)

gsathya refuses to suggest a suitable description for this
tutorial.

- [The Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

Nice tutorial that will get you up to speed with basic programming.

- [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)

A practical introduction to Common Lisp.

- [LLVM Tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html)

### Newer programming languages

- [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) 

Mozilla's new systems programming language, that aims to ultimately be
used for the things C++ is being used for at the moment.

- [Shen](http://www.shenlanguage.org/)

A functional (as in FP) Lisp.

### Programming Language Theory

- [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/)
- [Oleg Kiselyov's site](http://okmij.org/ftp/)

## Design

### Web

Learning how to make webpages is a handy skill to have. It
doesn't take very long to gain an understanding of the basics of HTML/CSS.

- [CSS Positioning](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101)
- [CSS Floats](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101)
- [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide)
- [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/)
- [HTML Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/)

## Tools

### Text editors

Knowing how to efficiently use a text editor is one of the most useful
secondary skills of any programmer.

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/others.php)

A modal text editor that many have been able to become proficient and
therefore productive in. It has nice keybindings and a focus on
developer productivity.

- [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/)

A text editor that is part of an operating system containing a
file-manager, calculator, games and even a package manager that is
written in a dialect of Lisp that many have been able to become
proficient and therefore productive in.

- [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/)

An feature-laden, easy to use text editor.

### Version Control

Version Control Systems (VCS) make it easy to do distributed
collaborative development.

- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)
- [Mercurial](http://hginit.com/01.html)

### Command-line

- [zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zsh)

A shell with nice completions.

### Window Managers

#### Tiling

Tiling window managers are useful when a lot of different programs are
being run e.g. in a typical programming session.

- [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/)

One of the more widely used Haskell programs.

- [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/)

### Graphics
- [Inkscape](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/)

A nice editor for creating vector graphics.

### Miscellaneous

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html)

Easily converts between markup formats.

Freely available specifications for various internet-related protocols.

## Programming Exercises

- [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

Lots of problems which require you to write programs to solve
them. Quite a few of these problems require some mathematical
knowledge.

- [Programming Praxis](http://programmingpraxis.com/)

Some practical programming problems in addtition to the sorts of
problems found at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)
