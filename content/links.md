## Programming

### Tutorials

If you are new to programming, read
[SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) or the
[Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) first.

- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

An introduction to computation and programming.

- [Learn you a Haskell for great good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

A good tutorial to learn the basics of functional programming with Haskell.

- [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html)

A modern introduction to web development using Javascript.

- [Why's poignant guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)

[gsathya](http://gsathya.in/) refuses to suggest a suitable description for this
tutorial.

- [The Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

Nice tutorial that will get you up to speed with basic programming.

- [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)

A practical introduction to Common Lisp.

- [LLVM Tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html)

### Newer programming languages

- [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) 

Mozilla's new systems programming language, that aims to ultimately be
used for the things C++ is being used for at the moment.

- [Shen](http://www.shenlanguage.org/)

A functional (as in FP) Lisp.

### Programming Language Theory

- [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/)
- [Oleg Kiselyov's site](http://okmij.org/ftp/)

## Design

### Web

Learning how to make webpages is a handy skill to have. It
doesn't take very long to gain an understanding of the basics.

## Tools

### Text editors

Knowing how to efficiently use a text editor is one of the most useful
secondary skills of any programmer.

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/others.php)

A modal text editor that has nice keybindings. Its emphasis is on
speed.

- [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/)

A text editor that is part of an operating system containing a
file-manager, calculator, games and even a package manager. It can be
extended in trivial and extremely non-trivial ways with Emacs Lisp.

- [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/)

A feature-laden, easy to use text editor.

- [LightTable](http://www.lighttable.com/)

A new interactive IDE.

### Version Control

A Version Control System (VCS) is used to track changes in files. It
also makes distributed collaborative development possible.

- [Mercurial](http://hginit.com/01.html)

Mercurial is supposedly easier to learn and use when compared to
Git. This tutorial covers the basics of version control using
Mercurial.

- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)

A solid introduction to the powerful Git version control system.

### Command-line

- [zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zsh)

A shell with nice completions.

### Window Managers

#### Tiling

Tiling window managers are useful in a typical programming session
when you have to repeatedly switch between your text-editor, terminal
emulator, web-browser, and any other programs you may have running.

- [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/)

One of the more widely used Haskell programs.

- [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/)

### Graphics
- [Inkscape](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/)

The best open source SVG editor there is.

### Miscellaneous

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html)

Easily converts between a great variety of markup formats.

Freely available specifications for various internet-related protocols.

## Programming Exercises

- [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

Lots of problems which require the use of programs to solve them. Many
of these problems require some mathematical knowledge.

- [Programming Praxis](http://programmingpraxis.com/)

Some practical programming problems in addtition to the sorts of
problems found at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

## Operating Systems

- [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)

[neena](http://neena.at/) says that it is a decent operating system. A
widely used, stable Linux distribution.

- [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)

and having the latest software packages. Rolling releases keep your
system at the bleeding edge.
