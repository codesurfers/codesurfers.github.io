1. Print a (possibly) nested list. Bonus points if you print a nested hash-table.
2. A command line program that downloads multiple files in parallel.
3. A foreign function interface to a small C library. (If you primarily use C, this is not a valid exercise for you.)
4. Mess with a database interaction library in the language of your choice.
